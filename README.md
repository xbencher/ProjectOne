Steps to execute the solution -
First unzip the file.
1)Open your Android Studio and if any project is opened just close it (Go to File->Close Project) then you'll see a small window.
2)Click on Import Project(Gradle, Eclipse ADT etc), then you’ll get a dialog box.
3)Here, browse your project by navigating the location where you kept your project, your project’s folder will appear with an Android logo on it 
4)Select the app and click OK, this will take some time for the Gradle to build, wait for the loading time. (You might get error here stating the different SDK location)
5)In case of the above error just go to Project Directory and you’ll then find the file named “local.properties” in the root folder of your project. Open this file and scroll to the last 2 lines “ndk” and “sdk” and change the location with the one of your SDK and save the file.
6)Again open the project or else if already opened in Android studio go to Gradle->Rebuild.
7)You have now successfully imported the project in Android Studio.
